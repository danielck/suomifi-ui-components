Suomi.fi Design System offers spacing tokens to use for defining paddings and margins for elements. Using tokens helps in building and maintaining uniform user interfaces. See list of [spacing tokens](./#/Spacing/Tokens).

Most components in Suomi.fi component library also support margin properties. Margin properties accept spacing tokens (excluding inset spacing tokens) as value. See usage of [margin props](./#/Spacing/Margin%20props).
