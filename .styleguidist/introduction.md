## ðŸ“¦ Install

To install the component library

```bash
npm install suomifi-ui-components
```

Include **required** fonts as best suited for your project. You can, for example, use the following import with your global css.

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Source+Sans+Pro:300,400,600&display=swap');
```

### Peer dependencies

You should also install the following peer dependencies.

- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) version >=16.8.0 and related dependencies and typings.
- [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components) version >=5.2.1 and related dependencies and typings.

- The aim is to keep dependencies up to date and use the latest available versions. We encourage you to use the latest available versions of peer dependencies.

```bash
npm install styled-components
```

- If using TypeScript, version 3.8 or above is required.

- In case TypeScript is used and skipLibCheck compiler option is set to false, also add typings for [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/styled-components/) as well as [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/react-dom) as required by the React version used.

```bash
npm install @types/styled-components @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## ðŸ”¨ Usage

```jsx static
import { Button } from 'suomifi-ui-components';
<Button>Suomi.fi button</Button>;
```

### ðŸŒŠ `Component variants`

Components have a `variant` property for different versions of the component.

```jsx static
import { Button } from 'suomifi-ui-components';
<Button variant="secondary">This is a seconday button</Button>;
```

### â›± Extending styles

Components' styles can be customized with [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components):

```javascript static
styled(Button)...
```

**or** using CSS-ClassName:

```jsx static
<Button className="button--custom">Example</Button>
```

```css
.fi-button.button--custom {
  ...;
}
```

Don't use `!important`. If really, really needed you can define styles using classNames multiple times `.fi-button.button--custom.button--custom {...}` for a specificity hack.
