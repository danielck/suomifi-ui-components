The `<TimeInput>` component is used to input times. It consists of two inputs (hours and minutes) which are labelled and visually presented together as one input.

TimeInput is typically used together with [DateInput](/#/Components/DateInput).

### Basic use

```jsx
import { TimeInput } from 'suomifi-ui-components';

<TimeInput
  labelText="From"
  hintText="Opening hours of your business"
/>;
```
